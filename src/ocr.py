prompt = """Task: Extract **all text and details** from medical bottle images captured from various angles (90째, 180째, 270째, 360째). The goal is to accurately identify and extract **all printed information**, including product names, ingredients, usage instructions, manufacturing details, and any other relevant text. Ensure the extracted data is combined into **one structured output**.

Images:
The provided images feature the same medical bottle captured from multiple perspectives. Extract and consolidate all text across images into a **single, structured format**.

### Requirements:

**1. Text Extraction:**
- Capture every printed detail, including:
  - **Product name**
  - **Medicinal ingredients** (including herbs, chemicals, and dosage forms)
  - **Non-medicinal ingredients**
  - **Indications / Product description**
  - **Directions for use**
  - **Manufacturer details** (phone, address, website, etc.)
  - **LOT **
  - **Expiry date  / EXP**
  - **Warnings / Cautions / Additional instructions**
  - **Symbols or other markings** (e.g., regulatory labels, certifications, NPN numbers)
  - **Address** or **contact information** printed on the bottle or packaging.

- Ensure **case sensitivity** is respected (e.g., "C" vs. "c").
- Extract all **letters, numbers, symbols, and special characters** with **accuracy**.
- **Handle multi-line text** and **wrapped text** seamlessly.

**2. Handling Complex Text:**
- **Differentiate between sections** (e.g., "Ingredients" vs. "Directions").
- Handle **text wrapping around curved surfaces** effectively.
- **Preserve formatting** to distinguish between structured lists and continuous text.

**3. Post-Processing:**
- **Verify extracted text** for accuracy and completeness. Flag missing or partially illegible text.
- If any portion of text is unclear, provide a **best-guess approximation** and **flag it for review**.
- Use **"None"** for missing, unreadable, or absent information.

### Final Output:

- **Combine all information** into a **structured JSON format** with appropriate key-value pairs.
- For each extracted field, include **all possible details**.
- Only give JSON output not other unnecessary information
- Example of the required JSON structure:
```json
{
  "product name": value,
  "description": value,
  'quantity': value,
  "medicinal ingredients": {ingredient: Quantity},
  "nonmedicinal ingredients": value,
  "directions": value,
  "manufacturer name": value,
  "manufacturer address": value,
  "manufacturer phone": value,
  "manufacturer website": value,
  "LOT": value,
  "expiry date": value,
  "additional markings": value,
  "additional information": value,
  "warnings": value
}```
